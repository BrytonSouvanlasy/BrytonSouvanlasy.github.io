### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1, this lab was one of my favorites because it was the first time I was able to code something. It was very difficult for me since it was my first time coding, but in the end I was able to get it done and get it submitted. 

* Lab 5
Lab 5 part 1 was also a one that I enjoyed working on. In this lab I was able to learn how to code a computer to calculate the area of a rectangle given the length and width. I found this one interesting based on much code it takes to do simple mathematic equations. 

* Lab 7 
    Lab 7, part 2 was one of my favorites because I was always interested in how blackjack works. I was also interested to see how it looked after people have coded the entire game.
